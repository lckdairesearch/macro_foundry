# Architecture

This document captures the decided architecture of `macro_foundry`. It is the source
of truth for how the system is structured and why. Do not deviate without writing
a new ADR and updating this file.

## Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.12+
- **Package manager:** `uv` (workspace not used; single package layout)
- **Database:** Postgres 18.4 locally via Docker; Neon (PG 18 default) for cloud
- **ORM / async driver:** SQLAlchemy 2.x async + psycopg3 (`postgresql+psycopg://`)
- **Migrations:** Alembic
- **Validation:** Pydantic v2 + pydantic-settings
- **API framework:** FastAPI (async)
- **Admin:** SQLAdmin (mounted at `/admin`)
- **CLI:** Typer
- **Tests:** pytest + pytest-asyncio + httpx.AsyncClient
- **Future (not this phase):** Next.js + Tremor frontend; LangGraph for the AI
  agent; an external scheduler (GitHub Actions / APScheduler) for ingestion.

## Why this stack — short summary of rejected alternatives

Each was considered explicitly and rejected. ADRs cover the reasoning.

- **PostgREST / Supabase / Hasura** — wrong validation philosophy for a curated
  layer; writes need to go through Python where structured rules and the future
  agent can share logic.
- **Django + DRF** — better admin, but SQLAlchemy 2.x beats Django ORM for the
  query patterns we need (CTEs, window functions, DISTINCT ON for the view).
- **SQLModel** — async support rougher than raw SQLAlchemy; doesn't save much
  once Create/Update/Read variants are required.
- **TimescaleDB** — Neon supports it now, but vanilla PG is sufficient at this
  scale and avoids tying us to one extension.
- **asyncpg** — faster than psycopg3 (~20-30% in tight loops) but requires
  `statement_cache_size=0` under PgBouncer and forces a different driver from
  sync code. Unified driver wins.
- **Native PG ENUM types** — rigid migrations; CHECK constraints over Python
  enums are more evolvable.

│  - latest_observations view                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Reads and writes both go through FastAPI. There is no second front door (no
PostgREST, no direct DB access for clients). SQLAdmin connects as the same
`macrodb_app` role as the API.

## Database roles

Two roles, both created in `docker/postgres/init/01_roles.sql` on first container boot:

- **`macrodb_owner`** — owns all schema. Used only by Alembic (`MACRODB_OWNER_URL`).
  Has full DDL on the `public` schema. Equivalent role on Neon is the project owner
  (created via Neon SQL on first setup).
- **`macrodb_app`** — used by FastAPI, SQLAdmin, ingestion (later), and tests
  (`MACRODB_APP_URL`). Has SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on all tables in `public`,
  plus `USAGE` on the schema. No DDL.

The split means: even if an app endpoint is compromised, it cannot ALTER tables or
DROP data. Migrations always run as a separate role with explicit credentials.

## Database connection details

- **Local:** one Postgres 18.4 container with two databases inside
  (`macrodb_dev`, `macrodb_test`). Both roles exist in both DBs.
- **Neon / cloud production:** use one physical production database,
  `macrodb_prod`, via the **direct endpoint** (not the `-pooler` suffix).
  Normal SQLAlchemy pooling. `psycopg3` doesn't aggressively use prepared
  statements, so the PgBouncer-transaction-mode compatibility issue that affects
  `asyncpg` doesn't apply.
- **Engine config:** `pool_pre_ping=True`, `pool_recycle=300`, `pool_size=5`,
  `max_overflow=10`. The pre-ping and recycle are required for Neon's scale-to-zero
  behavior — connections can be killed during idle suspend.

## Async patterns — what you must know

This catches every developer new to async SQLAlchemy. Read `code_standards.md` for
the canonical rules; here are the architectural reasons:

- **`expire_on_commit=False`** is required, not optional. In sync SQLAlchemy, commit
  marks loaded objects as stale, and the next attribute access silently re-fetches.
  In async, re-fetch needs `await`, but FastAPI's response serialization happens
  after the route returns the session — accessing attributes would crash. Setting
  this to False keeps in-memory state usable.
- **No lazy loading.** All relationships must be eager-loaded explicitly with
  `selectinload` or `joinedload`. If you see `MissingGreenlet`, this is why.
- **One session per request.** The `get_session()` dependency yields a session,
  rolls back on exception, closes at the end of the request.

## CRUD generator philosophy

Most tables (~14 of 18) are pure CRUD. Writing them by hand is repetitive and
introduces drift between endpoints. We use one in-repo `crud_router(model, ...)`
factory (~150 lines) that produces standard GET-list, GET-by-id, POST, PATCH,
DELETE routes with consistent behavior.

Tables with real semantic logic (`series` with cross-field validation,
`observations` with bulk insert and vintage handling, governance lifecycle endpoints)
get hand-written routes. The generator is opt-in per table, never imposed.

This is **not a third-party CRUD library**. We don't trust their maintenance status
or their fit with SQLAlchemy 2.x async. The generator is our code, simple to read,
simple to extend.

## Ingestion model direction

ADR 0010 supersedes the source-centric ingestion assumption. `ingestion_feed` is
a request-level execution unit: the runtime configuration for one upstream
request shape, not a child of one `series_source`.

The schema includes `ingestion_feed_member` as the member table between a
request-level feed and each logical `series_source` populated by that request.
The member carries the per-series extraction selector (`selector_type` plus
structured `selector_config`), active state, and optional execution order. Each
`series_source` has exactly one feed member.

`ingestion_run_log` remains feed-level and append-only: one row per execution of
the upstream request. `ingestion_run_log_member` records member-level provenance
for each attempted feed member, including per-member status, row counts, and
selector/parsing diagnostics. Ingested observations point to the member-level
run row that produced them, keeping the feed-level run reachable through the
member row.

The common provider shape remains one request-level feed with one active member.
Table-style and tree-style providers use one request-level feed with multiple
members. Do not add provider-specific code paths that hide this fan-out outside
the data model.

## Canonical series hierarchy

ADR 0010 also reopened canonical `series` hierarchy work. It is implemented via
`series_hierarchy_edges`, whose edges are part of the canonical series layer,
not provider-side ingestion metadata.

The hierarchy supports ragged depth, additive enrichment, and stored parent
observations. Macrodb keeps parent observations as published values even when
children exist and even when an aggregation rule is known.

Do not create hidden canonical placeholder nodes solely to mirror provider
indentation or skipped source-tree levels. A grouping node exists as a canonical
`series` only when it is analytically meaningful or directly published by a
source. Same-concept hierarchy edges are the default; cross-concept hierarchy
proposals require explicit human review.

## Enum enforcement

Single source of truth: Python `str, Enum` classes in `src/macro_foundry/enums/`,
grouped by domain. Used identically in SQLAlchemy models and Pydantic schemas:

```python
# Model
frequency: Mapped[Frequency] = mapped_column(
    SAEnum(Frequency, native_enum=False, name="ck_series_frequency"),
    nullable=False,
)

# Schema
class SeriesCreate(BaseModel):
    frequency: Frequency
```

The DB stores the value as a `VARCHAR` with a named CHECK constraint. Adding new
enum values later requires a hand-written Alembic migration (autogenerate is
unreliable for CHECK changes). This tradeoff is accepted.

`tags` are the explicit exception: they are curated lookup data seeded into the
database, not Python enums, because application code does not branch on a fixed
tag taxonomy.

## Foreign-key deletion policy

Every current foreign key declares an explicit `ON DELETE` rule. The default is
`RESTRICT` for canonical entities, hierarchy links, lineage-bearing rows, and
audit/history rows. `CASCADE` is reserved for pure membership rows and owned
extensions that have no standalone meaning. The canonical per-edge policy lives
in `docs/schema/db_er.txt`; rationale lives in ADR 0008.

## Seed strategy

Alembic owns schema. A separate Typer CLI owns seed data. They do not mix.

Seed data lives in `src/macro_foundry/seed/data/` as typed Python (not YAML/JSON —
the data is curated by developers and benefits from type-checked enum constants).
Where the schema exposes a stable natural key (`geographies.code`, `tags.name`,
`providers.name`), runners use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`. Where V3 does
not expose a uniqueness constraint (`provider_catalogs`, `geography_memberships`),
the seed runner reconciles by curated natural keys before insert/update. Re-running
`uv run macrodb seed` on an existing DB is safe and updates any fields whose
values have changed in the data files.

In-scope for this phase: geographies (ISO countries + major blocs + key
subnationals + selected subnational regions where curated)
and tags (the 7 fixed categories), plus a small default provider/provider-catalog
seed set. Concepts, series, and families still come later via the API/admin.

## Testing philosophy

Test the **generator and the constraints**, not every table individually.

With the CRUD generator pattern, the 80% of tables behave identically — testing
them all is wasted effort. Instead:

- 1 test: Alembic round-trip
- 3 tests: seed idempotency
- 8 tests: CRUD generator behavior (against one representative table — `concepts`)
- 10 tests: DB-level constraint enforcement (UNIQUEs, CHECKs, FKs, the view)
- 5 tests: hand-tuned route integration (series create, observations bulk, etc.)
- 1 test: end-to-end smoke (concept → family → series → source → observation → view)

Per-test transaction rollback for isolation. Seeds run once per session.

## Future directions, intentionally not built now

These are noted so they aren't accidentally pre-empted by current choices:

- **Materialized `latest_observations`** if the view becomes a hot path (current
  view is a regular view; can be swapped without API changes).
- **Cursor-based pagination on `observations`** (currently limit/offset).
- **Per-user auth, OAuth, JWT** (currently single bearer token).
- **PostgREST as a read-only second front door** for downstream consumers — an
  option once the schema stabilizes.
- **dbt for the derived-series transformation layer** — a real option later;
  in-Python computation is fine for now.
